            NorthBay Cash is not a lender – as such, we do not have control over
            the APR you will be offered. We display a Representative APR only as
            it is based on data offered from multiple lenders. Qualified
            consumers can get a loan with APR Rates ranging from 4.95% to a
            maximum of 35.95% and loans repayment period of 61 to 90 days. Your
            loan amount, APR and repayment term will vary based on your credit
            worthiness, state and lender or lending partner. Important
            Information: Some lenders and services may not be accessible to
            residents of all States based on lender’s preferences and
            legislation particular to that State.
